# TextSummarization

## Introduction
Text Summarization is one of those applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is bound to have a huge impact on our lives. 
With growing digital media and ever growing publishing – who has the time to go through entire articles / documents / books to decide
whether they are useful or not? Thankfully – this technology is already here.

Automatic Text Summarization is one of the most challenging and interesting problems in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It is a process of generating a concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources such as books, news articles,
blog posts, research papers, emails, and tweets.
The demand for automatic text summarization systems is spiking these days thanks to the availability of large amounts of textual data.

Text summarization can broadly be divided into two categories — Extractive Summarization and Abstractive Summarization.
* **Extractive Summarization**: These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack
them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive
method.
* **Abstractive Summarization**: These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary. Some parts of this summary may
not even appear in the original text.

In this repository, we will be focusing on the **extractive summarization** technique.
